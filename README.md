# NCAE Red vs Blue Competition
During my time enrolled at the University of North Florida, I participated in the NCAE Red vs Blue competition. I was the captain of a team of 8. Below are the resources we created, the event details, and the valuable knowledge we learned from this event. 
## Preparing for the Competition
This was the first Cyber Security Competition many of us had ever done, so we had a lot to learn in around a month. To be properly prepared, we used a variety of resources from both the internet and the NCAE website, along with making some notes and PowerPoints of our own.
- ### NCAE Content:
  - [Competition Basics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqux0fXsj7x3WYm6ZWuJnGC1rXQZ1018M)
    - The NCAE YouTube playlist is where a lot of my team first learned about Linux. We were able to practice Linux Administration, Networking, Routing, Services, and more. 
  - [Sandbox Mini Hacks](https://ui.sandbox.ncaecybergames.org/challenges)
    - The NCAE Mini Hacks allowed us to use Virtual Machines, along with Linux, for the first time, learning how to practice what we learned from various sources practically.
- ### Custom Resources:
  - [Command/Service Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XrNtJrgqn1LtroutYwVFUF1C5_BzhqNlThMmhYNokhs/edit)
    - Based on what we learned from NCAE and outside resources, we were able to make a giant document that compressed it all into a guide we were able to utilize during our competition.
