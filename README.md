**Event Details**: We were tasked with securing approximately 10 machines, each with a designated role (e.g., web server, DNS server). With our team of 7, we had 6 members actively working on the machines, while I, as the captain, ensured everything ran smoothly.  

## Key Technical Skills Gained  
- Accessing machines without credentials.  
- Configuring complex web content and database communication.  
- Delegating tasks effectively to enhance team efficiency.  
- Solving multiple CTF challenges, including scripting, reverse engineering, and trivia.  
- Configuring DNS servers and implementing secure backup servers.  
- Running SSH and FTP servers and managing their security.  

## What I Learned from the Event  
This was my first competition, and it came with a steep learning curve. Despite my preparation, I faced unexpected challenges, and at times I felt overwhelmed. Thankfully, my team, especially Alex, kept things running smoothly while I gathered my thoughts.  

One of the most valuable lessons I learned is the importance of teamwork and having reliable people to turn to. You can’t know everything, and facing new problems is part of the journey. I now understand that it’s crucial to stay calm, ask for help, and take breaks when needed. This experience made me a better leader, teammate, and cybersecurity specialist.  

I also realized that stressful events like this can reveal a lot about yourself. I’ve learned to handle pressure more effectively, approach challenges step-by-step, and take a more patient and methodical approach in future situations. The skills I gained during this competition will help me in every aspect of my personal and professional life.  

Thank you, NCAE, for this incredible learning experience!
