   - Responsibilities: Managing and securing the network infrastructure, and implementing active defense strategies against cyber threats.
- **Geo Archbold** - Web Security Specialist
   - Responsibilities: Securing web servers and services (e.g., Apache, NGINX), managing SSL/TLS certificates, and ensuring database security (with a focus on PostgreSQL and MySQL).
- **Bruce Smith** - Systems Security Engineer
   - Responsibilities: Ensuring secure configuration and management of SSH and FTP services, safeguarding against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Jacob Lee** - CTF Coordinator / Security Analyst
   - Responsibilities: Solving and managing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, analyzing security puzzles and incidents, and promoting team and individual skill development in cybersecurity.
- **Froylan Tellez** - Backup and Recovery Specialist
   - Responsibilities: Developing and implementing data backup strategies, ensuring data integrity and availability through effective recovery planning for all machines in the network.
- **Delali Simpson** - DNS Security Specialist
   - Responsibilities: Managing and securing DNS infrastructure, and implementing policies to prevent DNS attacks and vulnerabilities.
- **Chastity Bythwood** - Researcher / Documentation Specialist
   - Responsibilities: Maintaining comprehensive documentation, logging all events, and creating notes to support the team's efforts and knowledge sharing.

## Preparing for the Competition
This was the first Cyber Security Competition many of us had ever done, so we had a lot to learn in around a month. To be properly prepared, we used a variety of resources from both the internet and the NCAE website, along with making some notes and PowerPoints of our own.
- ### NCAE Content:
  - [Competition Basics Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqux0fXsj7x3WYm6ZWuJnGC1rXQZ1018M)
    - The NCAE YouTube playlist is where a lot of my team first learned about Linux. We were able to practice Linux Administration, Networking, Routing, Services, and more. 
  - [Sandbox Mini Hacks](https://ui.sandbox.ncaecybergames.org/challenges)
    - The NCAE Mini Hacks allowed us to use Virtual Machines, along with Linux, for the first time, learning how to practice what we learned from various sources practically.
- ### Custom Resources:
  - [Command/Service Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XrNtJrgqn1LtroutYwVFUF1C5_BzhqNlThMmhYNokhs/edit)
    - Based on what we learned from NCAE and outside resources, we were able to make a giant document that compressed it all into a guide we were able to utilize during our competition. 
  - [Machine Configurations PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HY_xXdgQ_eW-o6xLOcfd6rAkXAa1gjCJcTXOj9kxfWo/edit#slide=id.p)
    - Our first PowerPoint gave us a fundamental foundation for securing systems and configuring the networks for Kali, Unbuntu, and CentOS.
  - [Services PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16uhRGiZ3PHtEOM4jL6XqZ3qbtVnyW7YOP8q47wwn5VQ/edit#slide=id.p)
    - The second PowerPoint was more focused on learning the various services we would be defending on competition day, giving us a brief understanding of how they work and how to troubleshoot them. 
## Competition Day -  March 23rd, 10am - 5pm

### Details of Event
As shown above, we were responsible for securing several machines, each with a specified task. For example, one machine was the web server, while another was the dns server, and so on. Luckily, with 8 people we had 6 people on computers, the captain floating to keep things running smoothly, and a person assigned to documenting and logging everything that occurs. Below is an event log of most of the incidents that occurred during the event, as well as how we reacted and recovered.

## Skill Gained and Knowledge Earned 
We learned a multitude of topics from this competition. Whether or not we won did not matter as we gained the most from all the studying and preparing we did for the event. Below is some of the skills we gained from the NCAE Cyber Games:
- **Incident Response**: How to quickly and effectively respond to security incidents and breaches.
- **Network Security**: Skills related to securing a network, including understanding firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- **System Hardening**: Techniques for securing operating systems and applications to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Understanding and applying knowledge about current threats, vulnerabilities, and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.
- **Digital Forensics**: Skills related to investigating and analyzing cyber attacks to understand their nature, scope, and origin.
- **Log Analysis**: The ability to sift through system and network logs to identify signs of malicious activity.
- **Cybersecurity Best Practices**: Knowledge of industry-standard practices for securing IT environments, including password policies, patch management, and least privilege access.
- **Teamwork and Collaboration**: Working effectively as part of a team to defend against cyber threats.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills to address and mitigate security issues.
- **Communication**: The ability to communicate technical information effectively to team members and non-technical stakeholders.
